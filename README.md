- **Sign In:** 
 You can log into the application using your name. If you've signed in before, you'll see the notes you've previously created. If it's your first time, you can start fresh and create new notes from scratch.

- **Create note:** 
 You can create notes by adding a title and description. You can also assign a color to the note either when you're creating it or afterward. Feel free to change the note's color at any time.

- **Delete note:**
Delete your notes without worrying about losing themâ€”they will be moved to the "Trash" section. From there, you can either restore them back to the "Notes" section or delete them permanently.
